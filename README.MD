# Assembly overview with NASM

The assembly code in this repository works only under windows and there is no guarantee that it would work on any other platforms

In order to be able to compile and run these examples you need the following:
NASM : https://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/3.01rc9/
GCC for windows for linking : https://winlibs.com/
Pick Win64 or Win32 (without LLVM/Clang/LLD/LLDB)
The code has been linked with Win64 version.

For convenience, add gcc and nasm into your environment path
